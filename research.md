Climate polarisation is growing on Twitter.

In a new paper, due to be published this month in Nature Climate Change, our team investigates the trend of growing climate polarisation on Twitter.
Analysis of tweets relating to the COP climate summits reveals greater polarisation during COP26 than previously. This increase is associated with growing right-wing engagement (a 16-fold increase since COP21) and emerged following the global climate strikes in 2019. Surprisingly, one topic unites pro-climate and climate-sceptic groups — ‘political hypocrisy’ — accusations of which have increased since 2019.
