title: Climate Polarisation is growing on Twitter
permalink: /research/
---

In a new paper, due to be published this month in Nature Climate Change, our team investigates the trend of growing climate polarisation on Twitter.

Analysis of tweets relating to the COP climate summits reveals greater polarisation during COP26 than previously. This increase is associated with growing right-wing engagement (a 16-fold increase since COP21) and emerged following the global climate strikes in 2019. Surprisingly, one topic unites pro-climate and climate-sceptic groups — ‘political hypocrisy’ — accusations of which have increased since 2019.

HIGHLIGHTS

![](/assets/graph/figure2.png)
During COP21, only 1% of top influential accounts aligned with climate contrarian views. These accounts are highly specialised on climate issues and are not broadly known in the general public, for example Bjorn Lomborg and Steve Milloy (@JunkScience). During COP26, around 1 in 6 accounts expressed views in conflict with the pro-climate majority. Most of these accounts are not climate focused, but represent the broader political right.

There are two dominant Polarised communities during COP26. This figure shows a heatmap of ideological scores projected along a climate dimension (vertical axis) and a political dimension (horizontal axis), using influential accounts and their retweeters. Blue triangles mark the median ideological position of politicians associated with select political parties. Green points mark the median position of tweet topics (listed on the left). Bar charts indicate the distribution of account ideology scores along each axis. The method measures engagement with climate rhetoric, not action. Consequently, parties such as the Australian Liberals appear pro-climate. Major themes in the pro-climate majority include climate decolonisation, youth activism, criticism of right-wing political leaders, and themes of biodiversity and sustainable transport. In the opposed climate minority we see a range of themes associated with climate scepticism and other issues of relevance to the political right.

A theme that unifies the pro-climate majority and the opposed minority during COP is broad accusations of hypocrisy directed at political leaders and other COP attendees. Half of all accusations of hypocrisy around climate hypocrisy were made in the 12 months preceding COP26. The growth in climate polarisation appears to have emerged in 2019, likely during the global climate strikes.
