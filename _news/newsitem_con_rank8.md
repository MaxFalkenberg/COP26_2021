title: "The world's lungs breathed a sigh of relief when Lula won."
excerpt: "Tonight, Lula said that he would fight for a "zero-deforestation" target in the Amazon. Note that this is not a zero-illegal-deforestation target; he spoke about all deforestation. According to recent research, Luna's victory might stop the destruction of 75,960 km2 of the Amazon rainforest by 2030. The size of that territory is comparable to Panama. Brazil's emissions would be significantly reduced if this were done in conjunction with a renewed emphasis on forest restoration."
