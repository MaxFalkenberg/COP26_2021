We are a group of computational social scientists, physicists and climate scientists based in the UK and Italy.
This project was in part supported by funding from the UK Government.

Prior to working on data science related to climate change information, our group has contributed to pioneering work on the spreading of misinformation online ([article](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/3/554) / [media coverage](https://pnas.altmetric.com/details/4951559)), the Covid-19 infodemic ([article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73510-5) / [media coverage](https://nature.altmetric.com/details/91846881)), climate finance ([article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405880719300524)), and the formation of social norms ([article](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aas8827) / [media coverage](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-25-revolution-how-big-does-a-minority-have-to-be-to-reshape-society/)).
