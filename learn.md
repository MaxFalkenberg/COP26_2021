During last year's COP26 summit, our team found that polarisation around climate issues grew significantly, relative to previous summits. To learn more, <a href="/research">read our research</a>.

This year's UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP27) is being hosted in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, and aims to build on previous summits. In particular, it follows the Paris Agreement, agreed at COP21 in 2015, and the Glasgow Climate Pact, negotiated in 2021 at COP26.


To learn more about COP27, the Paris Agreement, and the need for action on climate change, the following links may be of interest:

### About this dashboard

This dashboard uses data from Twitter to track the online discussion around COP27. Using all tweets using the keyword term “cop27”, we investigate how users interact, the communities formed by user interactions, key themes in the hashtags used by ideologically opposed groups, COP related hashtags which are trending, and the global distribution of Twitter users engaged in the COP27 discussion. Our analysis is based on similarwork we carried out for COP26 last year.

### Disclaimer

All data downloaded for this project was extracted using the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research">Twitter API for Academic Research</a>.  In accordance with the terms of the Twitter API, we only display publically accessible information and have not matched any user data to user profiles outside of Twitter.

Algorithms used to rank user importance, to group users in communities, and to split users based on ideology, are all automated using standard techniques from network science - small changes in parameter algorithms can change results. The values and groupings shown should be understood as imprecise measures and not exact values. Please also note that user importance and groupings are determined based on tweets related to the COP summits only, not the general climate discussion on Twitter or elsewhere.

For privacy reasons, we do not label the communities, choosing to display community grouping in an unaltered manner.

Please remember that Twitter is not an unbiased social media platform, and that the data extracted is often not a fair representation of opinions and interactions in the wider population.
